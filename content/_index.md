This site is a companion to my "Azure, DevOps and the Commodore 64" presentation. The goal heres is to show that there really aren't any technical reasons not reap the benefits from adopting DevOps. To achieve this goal we build a fully functional DevOps pipleine using Azure DevOps and that icon of the 1980's: the Commodore 64.

## Session delivered at NDC Sydney 2019
